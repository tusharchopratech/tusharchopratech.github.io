Shorthand Practice 
------
* The main focus of the project is to provide free dictations to people who are learning Shorthand Language. Users are able to listen recordings and can check their shorthand from the app. Godaddy’s hosting is used as app server with php services to handle request from app. The app is published in Google Playstore and has over 18K downloads.
* Built android app for the students learning Shorthand language. Provides online dictations for practice with its solutions which is secured using oauth2 security. App has crossed over 150K users at Google Play store.
* Identified opportunity to develop application for Shorthand learning and practice.
• Worked with design, development and deployment of the product.
• Successfully launched and marketed the product over Google Play Store with over 400 thousand users.
• Currently working on social platform for local sports players.
• Tech: Python/Django, React Native/Expo, Android, Digital Ocean, PostgreSQL, AWS

Field Data Collection App 
------
Dec 2015 | Stack - Java, Swings, Mysql 
* The app used collect data from different remote areas and store that data in pdf and text files. The app uses locations services, camera, SQLite and Shared Preference to provide its functionality. The input was given by the user and app detects the location of the device, according to which a hierarchical file directory is created and text & pdf files stored in that path as output.

Buckler Android
------
Oct 2014 | Stack - Java, Swings, Mysql 
* The objective of the project is to provide maximum security and tracing mechanism in case you are not able to locate the mobile. Application provides four different types of security measures which will help you in locating the mobile under odd circumstances. First is to increase the volume of phone or remove it from silent mode via a simple message or keyword through SMS. Second is to choose the numbers of your near and dear ones and your phone will never be silent for them. Third is to choose the message or keyword you want others to SMS you so that your phone reverts back with your Latitude and longitude automatically. Fourth type of security will help you locate your stolen or lost mobile. Paper based on this app is published in International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA) with title “Droid Guard: An approach to make android secure” in May 2015, Volume 117 –Number 8.

Nuclear harzard zone estimation.
------
Jun 2014 | Stack - Java, Swings, Mysql 
* TWorked on a project to study the hazardous zone in a city or at any area after a nuclear accident. It takes input a square map with its known lat (top and bottom) and long (left and right). User can select the centre on the map with the help of mouse at which the accident took place. Other inputs are also given such as wind direction, intensity of explosion etc which are used to calculate the exact or nearly exact area on which the hazard will take place. It predicts the future prospects after a nuclear accident, which can be used to take initial steps for saving human life.

Medicom
------
Sep 2012 | Stack - Android, Java, SQlite, php, Rest APIs
* The objective of the application is to identify the possible substitutes of a medicine by comparing the salts present in it. This application is made on Android platform and is presented in app presentation event and won second prize in INNOVATION APP category in Bharti Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, New Delhi.

Hotel Management System
------
Jan 2012 | Stack - Java, Swings, Mysql 
* The project dealt with the development of an application to evaluate the total bill of a customer based on the check-in/check-out time and the service availed at hotel premises. The user interface for the application was developed in core java using java swings and applet, while MySQL was used as the application backend. JAVA Jar file was used to post/retrieve the data to/from the database. Business logic for the application was developed using core java as well

Other Apps on Google Play Store.
------
* College Fest and Events
* Vocab 15
* Gre Verbal Sentence Completion
* Reading Comprehensions etc.

Robot made for rescuing people in Kedarnath Tragedy in India
------
Mar 2014 
* This theme was given by IIT Roorkee for their competition. In this project two robots were used. The task of the first robot was to travel through difficult paths, rescue the people(which were balls in event) and handover the people to second robot who will take them to a safer place. The first robot was controlled by a controller and second robot was autonomous. The task of second robot was to start journey from the base and reach to accident point and wait for the people until they arrive. When people (balls in event) reach to second robot, the robot next movement would be triggered and it would return to its base automatically.

Line Follower 
------
Nov 2013 
* The aim of the project is to create a robot that can follow a black line on white surface or white line on black surface. In first method, the circuit was implemented by using basic logic gates IC that is 74** series and IR sensor. In Second method arduino and IR sensors were used and arduino was programmed in 'c' language. Third, a NPN transistor was used as a switch with Light Dependent Resister (LDR) to identify the line.

Maze Solver
------
Sep 2013  
* The project deals with the solving of line or wall maze in which robot is made using arduino and IR sensors(for line maze) or Ultrasonic Sensor(for wall maze). Various kinds of IC like L293DE (motor driver), opams, potentiometer are used and programmed in a way that can help the robot reach to the final end point.
